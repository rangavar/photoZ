# photoZ

This script is what I use to estimate the redshift of the source galaxy in strongly lensed galaxy-galaxy systems. It uses the pre-made templates based on Benitez et al. 2000, which I make available at: 

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3r4z4cfjvn15k77/AABnnd4NvzSJ9RB4TVT05aNxa?dl=0

By default, it is optimized to run on 50 cores, but one can change that easily in estimateMulticore123.py and photoz.csh.

This is a Bayesian likelihood estimator of photometric redshift. Given 5 band magnitude measurements, with the corresponding error bars in data.txt, this code calculates the redshift PDF for each galaxy, and compares it with the spectroscopic redshift. 

the data.txt which is the input file is organized as follows: 
1st row : ID
2nd row : g-band magnitude 
3rd row : g-band magnitudeâ€™s uncertainty
4th row : r-band magnitude
5th row : r-band uncertainty
7th row : i-band mag
8th row : i-band uncertainty
9th row : z-band mag
10th row : z-band uncertainty
11th row : y-band mag
12th row : y-band uncertainty

13th row : spectroscopic redshift

these galaxies and their photometry are selected from HSC 5-band grizy, and are selected to be in the redshift range 1 to 3. 
data.txt contain 200 galaxies.

to run the code: 
,,,
bash photoz.csh 
,,,
or preferably(to be able to kill the process if anything went wrong)  screen it via:
,,,
screen -S photoz -dm bash photoz.csh
,,,

outputs will be saved in 'probPlots' and 'outputs' directories which will be produced after running the code
the output folder will contain .pickle files for later analytic purposes
the probPlots folder will contain:
each galaxy's redshift PDF as galaxyID.pdf
each galaxy's numerical PDF as galaxyID.txt
estimated photometric redshifts plotted against spectroscopic redshifts as wrap.txt
outlier.txt containing the outlier fraction and the first sigma of the experiment

outliers are defined as abs(spectroscopic redshift - photometric redshift)/(1+spectroscopic redshift)>0.15
first sigma is defined as the abs(spectroscopic redshift - photometric redshift)/(1+spectroscopic redshift) 68 percentile

the first sigma and outlier fraction are defined similar to Tanaka et al. 2017 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05988)
the results you get here from my code are comparable to those of Tanaka et al. 2017, which has been performed on the same survey, but for comparably lower redshift galaxies.
